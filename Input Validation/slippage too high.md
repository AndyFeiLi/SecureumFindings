passing the value 1 into the amountOutMin parameter

it is possible to unbalance the pool by depositing a large amount of a single type of token into uniswap pool

attacker calls the burnUBI function

the value of amountOutMin is 1, so basically allowing a super high slippage for the trade

trade goes through with bad price due to an unbalanced pool

attacker can use flash loan to unbalance pool
