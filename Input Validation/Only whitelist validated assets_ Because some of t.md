Only whitelist validated assets: Because some of the functionality relies on correct token behavior, any whitelisted token should be audited in the context of this system. Problems can arise if a malicious token is whitelisted because it can block people from voting with that specific token or gain unfair advantage if the balance can be manipulated.

    Recommendation: Make sure to audit any new whitelisted asset.
