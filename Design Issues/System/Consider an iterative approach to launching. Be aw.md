Consider an iterative approach to launching. Be aware of and prepare for worst-case scenarios: The system has many components with complex functionality and no apparent upgrade path. 

    Recommendation: We recommend identifying which components are crucial for a minimum viable system, then focusing efforts on ensuring the security of those components first, and then moving on to the others. During the early life of the system, have a method for pausing and upgrading the system.
