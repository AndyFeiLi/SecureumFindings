Address codebase fragility: Software is considered “fragile” when issues or changes in one part of the system can have side-effects in conceptually unrelated parts of the codebase. Fragile software tends to break easily and may be challenging to maintain.

    Recommendation: Building an anti-fragile system requires careful thought and consideration outside of the scope of this review. In general, prioritize the following concepts: 1) Follow the single-responsibility principle of functions 2) Reduce reliance on external systems
