Use of hard-coded addresses may cause errors: Each contract needs contract addresses in order to be integrated into other protocols and systems. These addresses are currently hard-coded, which may cause errors and result in the codebaseâ€™s deployment with an incorrect asset. Using hard-coded values instead of deployer-provided values makes these contracts incredibly difficult to test.

    Recommendation: Short term, set addresses when contracts are created rather than using hard-coded values. This practice will facilitate testing. Long term, to ensure that contracts can be tested and reused across networks, avoid using hard-coded parameters.
