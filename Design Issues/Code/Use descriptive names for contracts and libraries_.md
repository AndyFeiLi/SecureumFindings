Use descriptive names for contracts and libraries: The code base makes use of many different contracts, abstract contracts, interfaces, and libraries for inheritance and code reuse.

However, with no descriptive naming conventions to signal which files would contain meaningful logic, codebase becomes difficult to navigate.
