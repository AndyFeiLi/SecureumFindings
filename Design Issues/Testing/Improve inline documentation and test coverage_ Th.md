Improve inline documentation and test coverage: The source-units hardly contain any inline documentation which makes it hard to reason about methods and how they are supposed to be used. Additionally, test-coverage seems to be limited. Especially for a public-facing exchange contract system test-coverage should be extensive, covering all methods and functions that can directly be accessed including potential security-relevant and edge-cases. This would have helped in detecting some of the findings raised with this report.

    Recommendation: Consider adding natspec-format compliant inline code documentation, describe functions, what they are used for, and who is supposed to interact with them. Document function or source-unit specific assumptions. Increase test coverage.
