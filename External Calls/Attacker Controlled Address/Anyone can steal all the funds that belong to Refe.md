Anyone can steal all the funds that belong to ReferralFeeReceiver: The ReferralFeeReceiver receives pool shares when users swap() tokens in the pool. A ReferralFeeReceiver may be used with multiple pools and, therefore, be a lucrative target as it is holding pool shares. Any token or ETH that belongs to the ReferralFeeReceiver is at risk and can be drained by any user by providing a custom mooniswap pool contract that references existing token holdings. It should be noted that none of the functions in ReferralFeeReceiver verify that the user-provided mooniswap pool address was actually deployed by the linked MooniswapFactory.

    Recommendation: Enforce that the user-provided mooniswap contract was actually deployed by the linked factory. Other contracts cannot be trusted. Consider implementing token sorting and de-duplication (tokenA!=tokenB) in the pool contract constructor as well. Consider employing a reentrancy guard to safeguard the contract from reentrancy attacks. Improve testing. The methods mentioned here are not covered at all. Improve documentation and provide a specification that outlines how this contract is supposed to be used.
