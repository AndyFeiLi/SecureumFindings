VaultCore.rebase functions have no return statements: VaultCore.rebase() and VaultCore.rebase(bool) return a uint but lack a return statement. As a result these functions will always return the default value, and are likely to cause issues for their callers. Both VaultCore.rebase() and VaultCore.rebase(bool) are expected to return a uint256. rebase() does not have a return statement. rebase(bool) has one return statement in one branch (return 0), but lacks a return statement for the other paths. So both functions will always return zero. As a result, a third-party code relying on the return value might not work as intended.

    Recommendation: Add the missing return statement(s) or remove the return type in VaultCore.rebase() and VaultCore.rebase(bool). Properly adjust the documentation as necessary.
