ERC20 transfers can misbehave: The _transferFromERC20 function is used throughout ACOToken.sol to handle transferring funds into the contract from a user. It is called within mint, within mintTo, and within _validateAndBurn. In each case, the destination is the ACOToken contract. Such transfers may behave unexpectedly if the token contract charges fees. As an example, the popular USDT token does not presently charge any fees upon transfer, but it has the potential to do so. In this case the amount received would be less than the amount sent. Such tokens have the potential to lead to protocol insolvency when they are used to mint new ACOTokens. In the case of _transferERC20, similar issues can occur, and could cause users to receive less than expected when collateral is transferred or when exercise assets are transferred.

    Recommendation: Consider thoroughly vetting each token used within an ACO options pair, ensuring that failing transferFrom and transfer calls will cause reverts within ACOToken.sol. Additionally, consider implementing some sort of sanity check which enforces that the balance of the ACOToken contract increases by the desired amount when calling _transferFromERC20.
