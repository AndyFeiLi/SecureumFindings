Incorrect safeApprove usage: The safeApprove function of the OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 library prevents changing an allowance between non-zero values to mitigate a possible front-running attack. Instead, the safeIncreaseAllowance and safeDecreaseAllowance functions should be used. However, the UniERC20 library simply bypasses this restriction by first setting the allowance to zero. This reintroduces the front-running attack and undermines the value of the safeApprove function. Consider introducing an increaseAllowance function to handle this case.

    Recommendation: safeIncreaseAllowance and safeDecreaseAllowance functions should be used
