cancelOrdersUpTo can be used to permanently block future orders: Users can cancel an arbitrary number of future orders, and this operation is not reversible. The cancelOrdersUpTo function (Figure 3.1) can cancel an arbitrary number of orders in a single, fixed-size transaction. This function uses a parameter to discard any order with salt less than the input value. However, cancelOrdersUpTo can cancel future orders if it is called with a very large value (e.g., MAX_UINT256 - 1). This operation will cancel future orders, except for the one with salt equal to MAX_UINT256.

    Recommendation: Properly document this behavior to warn users about the permanent effects of cancelOrderUpTo on future orders. Alternatively, disallow the cancelation of future orders.
