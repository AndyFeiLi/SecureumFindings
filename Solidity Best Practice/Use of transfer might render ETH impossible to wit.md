Use of transfer might render ETH impossible to withdraw: When withdrawing ETH deposits, the PayableProxyController contract uses Solidity’s transfer function. This has some notable shortcomings when the withdrawer is a smart contract, which can render ETH deposits impossible to withdraw. Specifically, the withdrawal will inevitably fail when: 1) The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function. 2) The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units. 3) The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the call’s gas usage above 2300.

    Recommendation:  sendValue function available in OpenZeppelin Contract’s Address library can be used to transfer the withdrawn Ether without being limited to 2300 gas units. Risks of reentrancy stemming from the use of this function can be mitigated by tightly following the “Check-effects-interactions” pattern and using OpenZeppelin Contract’s ReentrancyGuard contract.
