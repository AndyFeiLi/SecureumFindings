Not using upgrade safe contracts in FsToken inheritance: The FsToken contract is intended to be an upgradeable contract, used behind a proxy (namely, the FsTokenProxy contract). However, the contracts ERC20Snapshot, ERC20Mintable and ERC20Burnable in the inheritance chain of FsToken are not imported from the upgrade safe library @openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package but instead from @openzeppelin/contracts.

    Recommendation: Use the upgrades safe library in this case will ensure the inheritance from Initializable and the other contracts is always linearized as expected by the compiler.
