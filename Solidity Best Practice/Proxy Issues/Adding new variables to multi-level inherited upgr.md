Adding new variables to multi-level inherited upgradeable contracts may break storage layout: The Notional protocol uses the OpenZeppelin/SDK contracts to manage upgradeability in the system, which follows the unstructured storage pattern. When using this upgradeability approach, and when working with multi-level inheritance, if a new variable is introduced in a parent contract, that addition can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout of the child contract, causing critical misbehaviors in the system.

    Recommendation: consider preventing these scenarios by defining a storage gap in each upgradeable parent contract at the end of all the storage variable definitions as follows: uint256[50] __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions. In such an implementation, the size of the gap would be intentionally decreased each time a new variable was introduced, thereby avoiding overwriting preexisting storage values.
