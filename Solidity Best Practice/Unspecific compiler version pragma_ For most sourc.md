Unspecific compiler version pragma: For most source-units the compiler version pragma is very unspecific ^0.6.0. While this often makes sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of an application, it may be a security risk for the actual application implementation itself. A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up actually checking a different evm compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

    Recommendation: Avoid floating pragmas. We highly recommend pinning a concrete compiler version (latest without security issues) in at least the top-level “deployed” contracts to make it unambiguous which compiler version is being used. Rule of thumb: a flattened source-unit should have at least one non-floating concrete solidity compiler version pragma.
