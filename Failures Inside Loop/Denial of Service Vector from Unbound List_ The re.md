Denial of Service Vector from Unbound List: The reset() internal function (called by the replaceAll() function) resets the role linked list by deleting all the elements (i.e. nodes) part of the bearer mapping. The caller is bound by the number of elements that are being removed for a particular role . Calling the reset() function will exceed the current block gas limit (i.e. 8,000,0000) for more than 371 total elements in a role linked list. Similarly, the size() and toArray() functions also loop through the linked list. This essentially means that listers, unlisters, minters, pausers, unpausers and owners can perform denial of service attacks on the lists they administer. In a scenario where the Roles library is leveraged by other smart contracts, calling these two functions will also result in a potential denial of service after a certain number of elements have been included in the linked list (this number would depend on the gas cost of the Opcodes implemented by the calling functions).

    Recommendation: One way to ensure that the current block gas limit is not exceeded would be to introduce a condition in the add() function to check that the linked list size is strictly lesser than 371 elements before adding a new element. This additional condition would significantly increase the gas cost associated with calling the add() function, as a call to the size() function would be required to fetch the exact number of nodes in the linked list. Alternatively, the gasleft() Solidity special function could be used to make sure that going through the linked list does not exceed the block gas limit. Finally, the reset() could be changed to allow for removing an arbitrary number of nodes (by taking this number as a function parameter).
