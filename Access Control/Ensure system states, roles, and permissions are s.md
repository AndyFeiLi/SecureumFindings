Ensure system states, roles, and permissions are sufficiently restrictive: Smart contract code should strive to be strict. Strict code behaves predictably, is easier to maintain, and increases a systemâ€™s ability to handle nonideal conditions. Our assessment of Growth DeFi found that many of its states, roles, and permissions are loosely defined.

    Recommendation: Document the use of administrator permissions. Monitor the usage of administrator permissions. Specify strict operation requirements for each contract.
