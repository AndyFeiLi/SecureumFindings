Governance parameter changes should not be instant: Many sensitive changes can be made by any account with the WhitelistAdmin role via the functions setGovernanceParameter within the AMMGovernance and PerpetualGovernance contracts. For example, the WhitelistAdmin can change the fee schedule, the initial and maintenance margin rates, or the lot size parameters, and these new parameters instantly take effect in the protocol with important effects. For example, raising the maintenance margin rate could cause isSafe to return False when it would have previously returned True. This would allow the user’s position to be liquidated. By changing tradingLotSize, trades may revert when being matched, where they would not have before the change. These are only examples; the complexity of the protocol, combined with unpredictable market conditions and user actions means that many other negative effects likely exist as well.

    Recommendation: Since these changes are occasionally needed, but can create risk for the users of the protocol, consider implementing a time-lock mechanism for such changes to take place. By having a delay between the signal of intent and the actual change, users will have time to remove their funds or close trades that would otherwise be at risk if the change happened instantly.
