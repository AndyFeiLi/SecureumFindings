No incentive for bidders to vote earlier: Hermez relies on a voting system that allows anyone to vote with any weight at the last minute. As a result, anyone with a large fund can manipulate the vote. Hermez’s voting mechanism relies on bidding. There is no incentive for users to bid tokens well before the voting ends. Users can bid a large amount of tokens just before voting ends, and anyone with a large fund can decide the outcome of the vote. As all the votes are public, users bidding earlier will be penalized, because their bids will be known by the other participants. An attacker can know exactly how much currency will be necessary to change the outcome of the voting just before it ends.

    Recommendation: Short term, explore ways to incentivize users to vote earlier. Consider a weighted bid, with a weight decreasing over time. While it won’t prevent users with unlimited resources from manipulating the vote at the last minute, it will make the attack more expensive and reduce the chance of vote manipulation. Long term, stay up to date with the latest research on blockchain-based online voting and bidding. Blockchain-based online voting is a known challenge. No perfect solution has been found yet.
