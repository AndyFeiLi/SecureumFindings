Delegates can be added or removed repeatedly to bloat logs: Several contracts in the Yield Protocol system inherit the Delegable contract. This contract allows users to delegate the ability to perform certain operations on their behalf to other addresses. When a user adds or removes a delegate, a corresponding event is emitted to log this operation. However, there is no check to prevent a user from repeatedly adding or removing a delegation that is already enabled or revoked, which could allow redundant events to be emitted repeatedly.

    Recommendation: Short term, add a require statement to check that the delegate address is not already enabled or disabled for the user. This will ensure log messages are only emitted when a delegate is activated or deactivated. Long term, review all operations and avoid emitting events in repeated calls to idempotent operations. This will help prevent bloated logs.
